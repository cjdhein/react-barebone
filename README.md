# Barebone React
I got tired of having to delete a gazillion files every time after cloning
a typical react stack. This project features nothing but the bare minimum of developing a react application. It makes __no assumptions__ of how you apply Flux, it makes no assumptions of your stylesheet stack, no assumptions of testing frameworks; but it's very easy to add what you need.
 
__Included are__
* React
* Babel (for ES6 support)
* Webpack
* Webpack dev server 
* React Hot Loader

## Usage

Run ```npm start``` within the root folder. The main entry file is ```app/main.js```.
